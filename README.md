# Scientific-Computing-Assessment-1
This software is capable of tackling problems concerning both ordinary and partial differential equations. It can accurately solve initial value problems using Euler and 4th-order Runge-Kutta methods, isolate a limit cycle of periodic functions, use continuation to solve non-linear systems of equations with a varying parameter and implements finite difference methods for differential equations.

Each file can be run separately to perform different sub-problems associated with numerical continuation. However, the primary use for this software is its ability to perform continuation by varying a chosen parameter value in a specified equation/system of equations to show the effect the chosen parameter has on the system.

PDE solving file works for Dirichlet boundary conditions, however the reliability of other boundary conditions varies.

Examples of each file in use can be found at the bottom of each file.
